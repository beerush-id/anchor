/**
 * Creates a new lifecycle manager for handling component mount, cleanup, and rendering operations.
 *
 * The lifecycle manager provides three core methods:
 * - `mount()`: Schedules and executes mount handlers and effects
 * - `cleanup()`: Schedules and executes cleanup handlers and clears all handlers
 * - `render()`: Executes a render function within the component's context
 *
 * This function manages:
 * - Mount handlers registered via `onMount()`
 * - Cleanup handlers registered via `onCleanup()`
 * - Effects registered via `effect()`
 *
 * It also handles the proper execution order and cleanup of effects with their cleanup functions.
 *
 * @returns A Lifecycle object with mount, cleanup, and render methods
