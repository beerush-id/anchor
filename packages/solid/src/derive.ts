 * Creates a derived reference that transforms the value of a source state.
 *
 * This function takes a source state and a transformation function, and returns
 * a new constant reference whose value is automatically updated whenever the
 * source state changes. The transformation function is called with the current
 * value of the source state, and its return value becomes the new value of the
 * derived reference.
 *
 * The derived reference is automatically cleaned up when the containing SolidJS
 * component is unmounted.
 *
 * @template T - The type of the source state
 * @template R - The type of the derived value
 * @param state - The source state to derive from
 * @param transform - A function that transforms the source state value into the derived value
 * @returns A constant reference containing the transformed value
