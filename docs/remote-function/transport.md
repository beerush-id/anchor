# Transports

A **transport** is the pluggable mechanism that carries IRPC calls between the client and server. It handles serialization, batching, streaming, retry, and connection management — all invisible to your function signatures and business logic.

The [Overview](/remote-function/index.html) introduced transport agnosticism as an architectural superpower. This page goes deep into **how** each transport works, **when** to choose which, and **how** to build your own.

## The Transport Abstraction

Every transport implements the same abstract interface:

```typescript
abstract class IRPCTransport {
  abstract call(spec: IRPCSpec, args: IRPCData[], timeout?: number): Promise<IRPCData>;
  protected abstract dispatch(calls: IRPCCall[]): Promise<void>;
}
```

The base class handles batching and scheduling. The transport subclass handles the wire protocol. Your application code never interacts with the transport directly — it just calls the function stub.

This means you can swap from HTTP to WebSocket to BroadcastChannel by changing **one line** in your module configuration. Every function call, every component binding, every handler — completely untouched.

## HTTP Transport

The default transport for most applications. Uses standard HTTP POST requests with automatic batching and streaming responses.

**Package:** `@irpclib/http`

### Client Configuration

```typescript
import { createPackage } from '@irpclib/irpc';
import { HTTPTransport } from '@irpclib/http';

const irpc = createPackage({ name: 'my-api', version: '1.0.0' });

const transport = new HTTPTransport({
  endpoint: `/irpc/${irpc.href}`,
  timeout: 10000,
  debounce: 0,
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryMode: 'exponential',
  retryDelay: 1000,
});

irpc.use(transport);
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `endpoint` | `string` | `'/irpc'` | URL path for requests |
| `baseURL` | `string` | — | Base URL for cross-origin calls |
| `headers` | `Record<string, string>` | — | Custom headers on every request |
| `fetchOptions` | `RequestInit` | — | Custom fetch options (e.g., `credentials: 'include'`) |
| `timeout` | `number` | — | Default timeout in ms |
| `debounce` | `number` | `0` | Batching window in ms |
| `maxRetries` | `number` | `0` | Retry attempts on network failure |
| `retryMode` | `'linear' \| 'exponential'` | `'linear'` | Retry strategy |
| `retryDelay` | `number` | `1000` | Base delay between retries in ms |

### Server Setup (HTTPRouter)

```typescript
import '@irpclib/irpc/server';
import { HTTPRouter } from '@irpclib/http/router';
import { irpc, transport } from './lib/module.js';

// Import all constructor files
import './rpc/hello/constructor.js';

const router = new HTTPRouter(irpc, transport);

Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    if (req.url.endsWith(transport.endpoint) && req.method === 'POST') {
      return router.resolve(req, [
        ['token', req.headers.get('authorization')],
      ]);
    }
    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
  },
});
```

The router's `resolve()` method accepts the HTTP request and an `initContext` array — `[key, value]` tuples that seed the request context. Hooks and handlers read these values through `getContext()`, never touching the raw `Request` object.

### Custom Response Builder

Intercept response creation to dynamically append headers or modify the response:

```typescript
return router.resolve(req, [], async (body, init) => {
  await Promise.resolve(); // Let hooks flush side-effects

  const headers = new Headers(init.headers);
  headers.set('x-processed-by', 'anchor-router');

  return new Response(body, { ...init, headers });
});
```

### How Batching Works

When multiple calls happen in the same microtask, the transport batches them into a single HTTP POST:

```http
POST /irpc/my-api/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json

[
  { "id": "1", "name": "getUser", "args": ["123"] },
  { "id": "2", "name": "getPosts", "args": ["123"] },
  { "id": "3", "name": "getStats", "args": ["123"] }
]
```

### How Streaming Works

The server doesn't wait for all handlers to complete. It pushes sequential `IRPCPacketStream` chunks over HTTP chunked transfer encoding as each handler resolves:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{"id":"2","name":"getPosts","type":"answer","status":"success","data":[...]}
{"id":"3","name":"llamaModel","type":"answer","status":"pending","data":"Deep"}
{"id":"1","name":"getUser","type":"answer","status":"success","data":{...}}
{"id":"3","name":"llamaModel","type":"event","status":"pending","data":{"type":"set","keys":["data"],"value":"Deep in the void"}}
{"id":"3","name":"llamaModel","type":"close","status":"success"}
```

The client parses these NDJSON lines and routes each packet to the correct caller by `id`. Each packet carries a `type` — `answer` delivers the initial or final data, `event` carries incremental state mutations, and `close` signals completion.

### Performance

HTTP Transport achieves **6.96x faster** throughput than traditional REST through batching:

| Framework | Total Time | HTTP Requests | Speedup |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **IRPC** | **3,617ms** | **100,000** | **6.96x** |
| Bun Native | 25,180ms | 1,000,000 | 1.00x |
| Hono | 18,004ms | 1,000,000 | 1.40x |

*Benchmark: 100,000 users × 10 calls each = 1,000,000 total calls*

## WebSocket Transport

Persistent connections with lower latency and automatic reconnection. Best for real-time applications where sustained bidirectional communication is critical.

**Package:** `@irpclib/ws`

### Client Configuration

```typescript
import { WebSocketTransport } from '@irpclib/ws';

const transport = new WebSocketTransport({
  url: 'ws://localhost:8080',
  autoReconnect: true,
  maxReconnectAttempts: 5,
  reconnectDelay: 1000,
  connectionTimeout: 10000,
});

irpc.use(transport);
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `url` | `string` | — | WebSocket URL to connect to |
| `protocols` | `string[]` | — | Sub-protocols for the connection |
| `autoReconnect` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically reconnect on failure |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | `number` | `5` | Maximum reconnection attempts |
| `reconnectDelay` | `number` | `1000` | Delay between reconnection attempts |
| `connectionTimeout` | `number` | `10000` | Connection establishment timeout |
| `headers` | `Record<string, string>` | — | Headers for the upgrade request |

### Server Setup (WebSocketRouter)

WebSocket authentication happens at **upgrade time**, not per-message. Extract tokens from the upgrade request, attach them to `ws.data`, and forward them as `initContext` on each `resolve()` call:

```typescript
import { WebSocketRouter } from '@irpclib/ws/router';
import { irpc, transport } from './lib/module.js';
import './rpc/hello/constructor.js';

const router = new WebSocketRouter(irpc, transport, {
  fileBufferTTL: 30000, // Cleanup orphaned binary frames after 30s
});

Bun.serve({
  port: 8080,
  fetch(req, server) {
    const token = req.headers.get('authorization');
    if (server.upgrade(req, { data: { token } })) return;
    return new Response('WebSocket server running');
  },
  websocket: {
    async message(ws, message) {
      await router.resolve(message.toString(), ws, [
        ['token', ws.data.token],
      ]);
    },
    close(ws) {
      // Abort all active streams for this connection
      router.disconnect(ws);
    },
  },
});
```

### Connection States

Monitor the connection lifecycle:

```typescript
transport.state;  // 0=CONNECTING, 1=OPEN, 2=CLOSING, 3=CLOSED
transport.isOpen; // boolean

await transport.reconnect(); // Manual reconnection
```

Calls made while disconnected are queued and dispatched once reconnected.

### File Uploads over WebSocket

WebSocket transport supports `IRPCFile` via length-prefixed binary framing. The router buffers `ArrayBuffer` payloads and matches them to file pointers when the JSON payload arrives.

::: warning WebSocket File Upload Caveat
Large file transfers block the persistent socket pipeline. Other simultaneous RPC calls won't reach the server until the binary transfer completes. For applications with significant file uploads alongside real-time interactions, use **HTTP Transport** for file operations — the browser natively offloads HTTP uploads to a background thread.
:::

### Connection Disconnect

When a WebSocket connection closes, call `router.disconnect(ws)` to abort all active streams for that connection:

```typescript
websocket: {
  close(ws) {
    router.disconnect(ws);
  },
}
```

The router tracks `AbortController` instances per connection per stream. Disconnecting fires all of them, triggering cleanup functions in all active stream handlers.

## BroadcastChannel Transport

Zero-server communication within the browser — between tabs, windows, iframes, and Web Workers.

**Package:** `@irpclib/broadcast`

### Client Configuration

```typescript
import { BroadcastTransport } from '@irpclib/broadcast';

const irpc = createPackage({ name: 'my-api', version: '1.0.0' });

const transport = new BroadcastTransport({
  channel: irpc.href, // 'my-api/1.0.0'
  timeout: 30000,
});

irpc.use(transport);
```

::: tip Use `irpc.href` as Channel Name
Using the package's `href` (`name/version`) as the channel name provides automatic uniqueness, version-awareness, and zero manual channel management.
:::

### Router Setup (Worker)

```typescript
// worker.ts
import { BroadcastRouter } from '@irpclib/broadcast/router';
import { irpc, transport } from './lib/module.js';
import './rpc/data/constructor.js';

const router = new BroadcastRouter(irpc, transport);
```

That's it. The router listens on the BroadcastChannel and resolves incoming calls automatically.

### Use Cases

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Web Worker offload** | Run heavy computation (video encoding, data parsing) in a Worker without blocking the UI |
| **Multi-tab sync** | Keep shopping carts, notifications, or state synchronized across browser tabs |
| **Iframe communication** | Parent ↔ iframe messaging with type-safe function calls |
| **Offline-first** | Full execution without any server infrastructure |

### Context in BroadcastChannel

Unlike HTTP and WebSocket, BroadcastChannel has no incoming request object. Supply context via `initContext` when calling `resolve()` directly:

```typescript
router.resolve(requests, [
  ['token', self.workerToken],
]);
```

### Router Disconnect

Call `router.disconnect()` to abort all active streams when the Worker or context is shutting down:

```typescript
router.disconnect();
```

## Choosing a Transport

| Criterion | HTTP | WebSocket | BroadcastChannel |
|-----------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **Server required** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Latency** | Medium | Low | Lowest |
| **Persistent connection** | No | Yes | N/A |
| **Auto-reconnection** | N/A | Yes | N/A |
| **File uploads** | ✅ Best | ⚠️ Blocks socket | ✅ Structured clone |
| **Cross-tab** | No | No | Yes |
| **Web Workers** | No | No | Yes |
| **Offline** | No | No | Yes |
| **Setup complexity** | Simple | Medium | Simple |
| **Browser support** | Universal | Excellent | Modern |

**Use HTTP** for most server-client applications. It's the simplest, most compatible, and handles file uploads without blocking.

**Use WebSocket** when you need persistent low-latency connections for real-time features like live dashboards, chat, or collaborative editing.

**Use BroadcastChannel** when you need zero-server execution — offloading computation to Web Workers, syncing across tabs, or building offline-first architectures.

## Stream Lifecycle

All transports manage active streams through four cancellation boundaries:

### 1. Client Cancellation

Calling `.close()` on an `IRPCReader` sends a `CANCEL` packet to the router. The router invokes the stream's `AbortController` and drops the stream:

```typescript
const prices = watchPrices('AAPL');
prices.start();

// Later
prices.close(); // CANCEL packet → server cleanup
```

### 2. Context Signals

The router injects an `AbortSignal` into the request context. Handlers can listen to this signal for manual teardown:

```typescript
const signal = getAbortSignal();
signal?.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  // Clean up resources
});
```

### 3. TTL Timeouts

If a function defines a `ttl` spec, the router aborts the stream when the timeout is reached — regardless of whether the client is still connected:

```typescript
const watchPrices = irpc.declare<WatchPricesFn>({
  name: 'watchPrices',
  stream: true,
  ttl: 300000, // 5-minute maximum
});
```

### 4. Connection Disconnect

When a WebSocket connection closes or a BroadcastChannel router shuts down, calling `router.disconnect()` aborts **all** active streams for that connection. HTTP connections are managed per-request — when the client drops the connection, the router's `AbortController` fires.

## Context Management Across Transports

The router only manages the internal `AbortController`. All application-level context is your responsibility — injected via `initContext` at the integration point.

The critical architectural benefit: **hooks and handlers never reference transport-specific types**. They consume the same standardized keys regardless of which transport delivered the call.

### Define Your Contract Once

```typescript
// Shared hook — works on HTTP, WebSocket, and BroadcastChannel
const authHook = async () => {
  const token = getContext<string>('token');
  if (!token) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  setContext('user', await verifyToken(token));
};

// Register on any router
httpRouter.use(authHook);
wsRouter.use(authHook);
broadcastRouter.use(authHook);
```

### Inject Context Per Transport

Each transport maps its specific objects into the same standardized keys:

```typescript
// HTTP — extract from headers
router.resolve(req, [
  ['token', req.headers.get('authorization')],
  ['locale', req.headers.get('accept-language')],
]);

// WebSocket — extract from ws.data (set during upgrade)
router.resolve(msg, ws, [
  ['token', ws.data.token],
  ['locale', ws.data.locale],
]);

// BroadcastChannel — extract from worker globals
router.resolve(requests, [
  ['token', self.workerToken],
  ['locale', self.workerLocale],
]);
```

Hooks and handlers see `'token'` and `'locale'` everywhere. Zero transport awareness required.

## Custom Transports

Build a custom transport for any protocol by extending `IRPCTransport`.

### Client-Side: Override `dispatch()`

```typescript
import {
  IRPCTransport,
  IRPC_PACKET_TYPE,
  IRPC_STATUS,
  ERROR_CODE,
  type IRPCCall,
  type IRPCData,
  type IRPCPacketStream,
  type IRPCRequest,
  type TransportConfig,
} from '@irpclib/irpc';

class CustomTransport extends IRPCTransport {
  constructor(public config: TransportConfig & { url: string }) {
    super(config);
  }

  protected async dispatch(calls: IRPCCall[]) {
    try {
      // 1. Serialize calls into wire format
      const requests: IRPCRequest[] = calls.map(({ id, payload: { name, args } }) => ({
        id, name, args,
      }));

      // 2. Send via your protocol
      const response = await this.send(requests);

      // 3. Feed response packets back to each call
      for (const packet of response.packets) {
        const call = calls.find(c => c.id === packet.id);
        if (call) {
          call.enqueue(packet); // Drives IRPCReader → resolves/rejects
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // On network failure, enqueue error packets (triggers retry if configured)
      calls.forEach((call) => {
        call.enqueue({
          id: call.id,
          name: call.payload.name,
          type: IRPC_PACKET_TYPE.CLOSE,
          status: IRPC_STATUS.ERROR,
          error: { code: ERROR_CODE.UNKNOWN, message: (error as Error).message },
          createdAt: Date.now(),
        } as IRPCPacketStream<IRPCData>);
      });
    }
  }

  private async send(requests: IRPCRequest[]) {
    // Your custom protocol implementation
  }
}
```

**Key constraint:** `call.enqueue(packet)` is the **only** way to feed data back. It drives the internal `IRPCReader`, which resolves standard calls or populates stream subscriptions.

### Server-Side: Build a Router

Use `IRPCResolver` to validate and execute requests, and `IRPCStream` to normalize outputs into `IRPCPacketStream` packets:

```typescript
import {
  IRPCResolver,
  IRPCStream,
  createContext,
  withContext,
  type IRPCPackage,
  type IRPCRequest,
} from '@irpclib/irpc';

class CustomRouter {
  constructor(
    private module: IRPCPackage,
    private transport: CustomTransport,
  ) {}

  async resolve(rawMessage: string, initContext: [string | symbol, unknown][] = []) {
    const requests: IRPCRequest[] = JSON.parse(rawMessage);

    const promises = requests.map((irpcReq) => {
      const resolver = new IRPCResolver(irpcReq, this.module);
      const ctx = createContext<string | symbol, unknown>([...initContext]);

      return withContext(ctx, async () => {
        const stream = new IRPCStream(irpcReq.id, irpcReq.name, () => resolver.resolve());

        stream.pipe((packet) => {
          this.sendPacket(JSON.stringify(packet));
        });

        await new Promise<void>((done) => stream.close(done));
      });
    });

    await Promise.allSettled(promises);
  }

  private sendPacket(data: string) {
    // Your custom protocol send implementation
  }
}
```

`IRPCStream` handles both standard and stream responses transparently — your router doesn't need to know which type the handler returns.

### Custom Transport Checklist

Custom transports **must**:

1. Override `dispatch()` — accept `IRPCCall[]` and serialize them for transmission
2. Feed packets via `call.enqueue()` — match response packets to calls by `id`
3. Handle errors — enqueue error packets on network failure so retry logic activates
4. Implement a router — use `IRPCResolver` + `IRPCStream` to execute and stream responses
