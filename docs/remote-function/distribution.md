# Distribution

Distribution is how your IRPC functions reach production — how they're packaged, versioned, routed to different servers, published to registries, and dynamically swapped at runtime. 

The [Overview](/remote-function/index.html) mentioned transport agnosticism and edge distribution as architectural superpowers. This page goes deep into the **mechanics** of each pattern and how to implement them.

## The Package System

Every IRPC function belongs to a **package**. A package is a named, versioned namespace that groups functions and binds them to a transport.

```typescript
import { createPackage } from '@irpclib/irpc';
import { HTTPTransport } from '@irpclib/http';

export const irpc = createPackage({
  name: 'my-api',
  version: '1.0.0',
});

export const transport = new HTTPTransport({
  endpoint: `/irpc/${irpc.href}`, // '/irpc/my-api/1.0.0'
});

irpc.use(transport);
```

### Package Identity

`irpc.href` returns `name/version` — a unique identifier that serves as:
- The HTTP endpoint path
- The WebSocket message namespace
- The BroadcastChannel name
- The wire-protocol routing key

This means `getUser` in `auth/1.0.0` never collides with `getUser` in `billing/2.0.0` — even if they share the same transport or server instance.

### Version Boundaries

The version is part of the execution payload. If a client running `1.0.0` stubs sends a call to a server running `2.0.0` handlers, the routing key won't match. This prevents silent contract breakage across deployments — the version mismatch surfaces immediately as a routing error instead of a subtle data shape bug.

## Microservice Distribution

Because each package accepts its own transport instance, you can distribute your architecture across microservices without an API gateway:

```typescript
// User service — runs on server A
export const userService = createPackage({ name: 'users', version: '1.0.0' });
userService.use(new HTTPTransport({
  endpoint: 'https://server-a.internal/irpc/users/1.0.0',
}));

// Project service — runs on server B
export const projectService = createPackage({ name: 'projects', version: '1.0.0' });
projectService.use(new HTTPTransport({
  endpoint: 'https://server-b.internal/irpc/projects/1.0.0',
}));

// Declare functions on their respective packages
export const getUser = userService.declare<GetUserFn>({ name: 'getUser' });
export const getProject = projectService.declare<GetProjectFn>({ name: 'getProject' });
```

From the client's perspective, they just call `await getUser()` and `await getProject()` normally. The packages route the execution payloads to their respective microservices behind the scenes. No URL manipulation, no routing configuration, no API gateway.

### Multi-Transport Microservices

You can even mix transports across microservices:

```typescript
// Real-time service — WebSocket for low-latency streaming
export const realtimeService = createPackage({ name: 'realtime', version: '1.0.0' });
realtimeService.use(new WebSocketTransport({
  url: 'wss://realtime.internal',
}));

// Batch service — HTTP for large payloads and file uploads
export const batchService = createPackage({ name: 'batch', version: '1.0.0' });
batchService.use(new HTTPTransport({
  endpoint: 'https://batch.internal/irpc/batch/1.0.0',
}));
```

The client calls `watchPrices('AAPL')` and `uploadReport(file)` with identical syntax. The packages route one over WebSocket and the other over HTTP — completely transparent.

## NPM Distribution

IRPC's strict separation between declaration (`index.ts`) and implementation (`constructor.ts`) enables a powerful distribution model: **publish your API stubs to NPM while keeping your server logic private**.

### How It Works

Your `index.ts` files contain only the function signatures and spec metadata — no business logic, no database connections, no secrets. These files are safe to publish. Client teams install the package and get full TypeScript autocomplete, type-checked arguments, and compile-time error detection — without ever seeing your server code.

### Project Structure

```
my-api/
├── lib/
│   └── module.ts          # Package + transport config
├── rpc/
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── index.ts       # ✅ Published — type stubs
│   │   └── constructor.ts # ❌ Private — server logic
│   └── billing/
│       ├── index.ts       # ✅ Published
│       └── constructor.ts # ❌ Private
├── server.ts              # ❌ Private — server setup
├── package.json
└── .npmignore
```

### Configure `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "module": "./dist/index.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js"
    },
    "./*": "./dist/rpc/*"
  },
  "files": ["dist"]
}
```

### Exclude Server Code

Use `.npmignore` to exclude all server-side files:

```
# Source code (keep only dist/)
src

# Server implementation files
**/constructor.ts
**/constructor.js

# Server entry point
server.ts
server.js

# Environment
.env
.env.example
```

### Build and Publish

```bash
# Build client-safe stubs
npm run build

# Publish to NPM (or your private registry)
npm publish
```

### Client Installation

```bash
npm install my-api
```

```typescript
import { getUser, createUser } from 'my-api/users';

const user = await getUser('123');
const newUser = await createUser({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });
```

The stubs connect to your server's transport endpoint. Type safety is enforced at compile time. Your handler logic remains absolutely private on your server.

## Dynamic Edge Distribution

The most powerful distribution pattern: **dynamically routing functions to different execution environments at runtime** — without changing a single line of component code.

### The Problem

Supporting cost-effective "Free Tiers" typically requires duplicating your API logic to run entirely in the browser, creating an unmaintainable branching architecture between local code and server code.

### The Solution

Because IRPC separates the declaration from the transport, you can swap the execution target at runtime:

```typescript
import { createPackage } from '@irpclib/irpc';
import { HTTPTransport } from '@irpclib/http';
import { BroadcastTransport } from '@irpclib/broadcast';

export const irpc = createPackage({ name: 'my-api', version: '1.0.0' });

function configureTransport(plan: 'free' | 'paid') {
  if (plan === 'paid') {
    // Execute on your robust cloud servers
    irpc.use(new HTTPTransport({
      endpoint: 'https://api.yourservice.com/irpc/my-api/1.0.0',
    }));
  } else {
    // Execute locally in a Web Worker — zero server costs
    irpc.use(new BroadcastTransport({
      channel: irpc.href,
    }));
  }
}
```

For a **paid user**, the transport points to your cloud servers with full database access, GPU compute, and external integrations.

For a **free user**, the transport points to a local Web Worker running the same handlers with limited local data. Your cloud servers are never touched.

**Your frontend component logic remains 100% identical.** The UI has no idea whether `generateReport()` resolved on AWS or a local background thread. The function call is the same. The return type is the same. The component binding is the same.

### Worker-Side Setup

The Web Worker hosts the same handler implementations, running locally:

```typescript
// worker.ts
import { BroadcastRouter } from '@irpclib/broadcast';
import { irpc, transport } from './lib/module.js';

// Import the same constructor files
import './rpc/reports/constructor.js';
import './rpc/analytics/constructor.js';

const router = new BroadcastRouter(irpc, transport);
```

The handlers can use IndexedDB, local computation, or limited external APIs. The architecture is identical — only the transport destination changed.

## Monitoring (IRPCStore)

IRPC provides a global store for observing the system's live state. Packages, routers, and streams self-register — no manual tracking.

```typescript
import { IRPC_STORE } from '@irpclib/irpc';
```

### Live Tracking

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `IRPC_STORE.packages` | `Set<IRPCPackage>` | All registered packages |
| `IRPC_STORE.routers` | `Set<IRPCRouter>` | All active routers |
| `IRPC_STORE.calls` | `Set<IRPCCall>` | All in-flight calls |

### Event Subscription

```typescript
const unsubscribe = IRPC_STORE.subscribe((event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'register': // Package or router registered
      break;
    case 'route':    // Router begins resolving a request batch
      break;
    case 'queue':    // New call added to in-flight set
      break;
    case 'dequeue':  // Call resolved/rejected, removed from in-flight
      break;
  }
});
```

### What You Can Build

The store is a **live window**, not a log. It tracks what's active right now. Zero overhead when nobody subscribes. Build on top of it:

- **Request logging** — Log every function call with timing data
- **Metrics dashboards** — Track throughput, error rates, stream durations
- **Alerting** — Detect anomalies in call patterns or error spikes
- **DevTools extensions** — Visualize the live IRPC state in browser DevTools
- **Health checks** — Monitor active streams and router status

```typescript
// Example: Simple request logger
IRPC_STORE.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'queue') {
    console.log(`[IRPC] Call started: ${event.detail.payload.name}`);
  }
  if (event.type === 'dequeue') {
    console.log(`[IRPC] Call completed: ${event.detail.payload.name}`);
  }
});
```

## Security Model

IRPC's file separation enables a clean distribution model:

| Layer | Contains | Typically Published? |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Declaration** (`index.ts`) | Type signatures, spec metadata | ✅ Safe to publish |
| **Implementation** (`constructor.ts`) | Business logic, DB queries, secrets | ⚠️ Up to you |
| **Module** (`module.ts`) | Package config, transport wiring | ⚠️ Client-safe parts only |
| **Server** (`server.ts`) | Router setup, hook registration | ⚠️ Up to you |

The declaration file contains **zero executable logic**. It's a type-level contract. Even if someone decompiles the published JavaScript, they get empty function stubs and spec metadata — no business logic, no database drivers, no environment variables.

### Hook-Based Authorization

Security enforcement happens in hooks, not in the transport:

```typescript
// Global auth — runs before every handler
router.use(async () => {
  const token = getContext<string>('token');
  if (!token) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  setContext('user', await verifyToken(token));
});

// Per-function authorization — runs before specific handlers
irpc.hook(deleteUser, async (req) => {
  const user = getContext<User>('user');
  if (!user?.admin) throw new Error('Forbidden');
});
```

Because hooks consume standardized context keys (not transport-specific types), the same auth logic works across HTTP, WebSocket, and BroadcastChannel routers without modification.
