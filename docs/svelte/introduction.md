# Introduction to Anchor for Svelte

Anchor enhances Svelte's already excellent reactivity system by providing intuitive direct mutation, true immutability,
and data integrity. While Svelte's fine-grained reactivity is powerful, Anchor adds additional capabilities that make
state management even more intuitive and robust.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Fine-grained reactivity | ✅                     | ✅                |
| Direct mutation         | ✅                     | ✅                |
| Nested reactivity       | ✅                     | ✅                |

## Why Anchor for Svelte?

Svelte's reactivity system is built on signals and effects, providing excellent performance through fine-grained updates.
However, as applications grow in complexity, developers often face challenges:

- Managing complex state sharing across components
- Ensuring true immutability without performance penalties
- Maintaining data integrity across state mutations
- Working with structured data that requires validation

Anchor addresses these challenges while maintaining full compatibility with Svelte's reactivity model.

## Key Benefits

### 1. State Sharing

With Anchor, you can declare your state anywhere and share it across any framework since it's framework agnostic. This makes it especially powerful for micro-frontend architectures or when migrating between frameworks.

Svelte's runes, for instance, must be declared in `.svelte.ts` or `.svelte.js` files, and `$state` declarations must be assigned directly to a `let` or `const` variable. Anchor does not have these limitations, offering more flexibility.

Consider this example with Svelte's context API:

```ts
export function usePopup(init?: PopupState): PopupState {
  let current = getContext(POPUP_CONTEXT) as PopupState;

  if (!current) {
    const state = $state<PopupState>(init ?? { open: false }); // [!code --]
    current = state; // [!code --]
    setContext(POPUP_CONTEXT, state);
  }

  return current;
}
```

With Anchor, the same can be achieved more concisely:

```ts
export function usePopup(init?: PopupState): PopupState {
  let current = getContext(POPUP_CONTEXT) as PopupState;

  if (!current) {
    current = anchorRef(init ?? { open: false }); // [!code ++]
    setContext(POPUP_CONTEXT, current);
  }

  return current;
}
```

### 2. True Immutability

Anchor provides true immutability through controlled mutations. State objects are genuinely immutable except through
defined contracts, preventing accidental mutations while maintaining performance.

- [Immutability API Reference](/apis/svelte/initialization#immutable-apis) - API reference for immutability.

### 3. Data Integrity

With schema support and runtime validation, Anchor ensures your state maintains its structure and data types, catching
errors early in development.

- [Schema Support](/svelte/getting-started#schema-support) - Learn more about schema support.
- [Schema API Reference](/apis/svelte/initialization#data-integrity-apis) - API reference for schema support.

## Svelte Integration

Anchor's Svelte integration is designed to be lightweight and seamless:

- Automatic tracking binding with Svelte's reactivity system
- Proper cleanup when components are destroyed
- No additional providers or setup required
- Full compatibility with Svelte's component lifecycle

The integration works by setting up a global tracker that binds Anchor's observer system with Svelte's component
instances, ensuring that components re-render only when the specific state they access changes.

## Learning Investment

While Svelte's reactivity system is already powerful, Anchor provides additional tools that enhance the developer
experience:

- Reduced boilerplate for complex state operations
- Better debugging through explicit mutation contracts
- Enhanced performance through smart tracking
- Improved maintainability with structured state

Anchor is designed for developers who want to leverage Svelte's excellent reactivity while benefiting from additional
features that enhance code quality and maintainability.
