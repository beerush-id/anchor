# **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Anchor State Management**

Find answers to common questions about Anchor, the revolutionary state management library for modern web applications.

## **What is Anchor?**

Anchor is a revolutionary state management framework for modern web applications. It introduces the **DSV (Data-State-View) model**, a new architectural philosophy that redefines how you build reactive user interfaces. Anchor focuses on the **AX (All eXperience) philosophy**, which aims to empower developers with intuitive code while providing users with a blazing-fast, fluid experience.

## **What makes Anchor different from other state management libraries?**

Anchor stands out from other state management solutions with several unique features:

1. **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Only components that depend on specific state changes are re-rendered, eliminating wasted renders
2. **True Immutability**: Direct mutation syntax with proxy-based write contracts for safety without performance penalties
3. **DSV Architecture**: Clean Data-State-View separation that eliminates prop drilling and context hell
4. **Integrated Built-ins**: Includes optimistic UI, history tracking, reactive storage, and reactive requests out of the box
5. **Framework Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript

## **How does Anchor's performance compare to other solutions?**

Anchor is designed for maximum performance with:

- **Fine-Grained Updates**: Only relevant components are re-rendered
- **Optimized State Updates**: No deep cloning required for mutations
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight library with fast startup times
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Designed to consume minimal resources

In benchmark tests, Anchor significantly outperforms traditional state management solutions, especially as applications scale.

## **Is Anchor suitable for large applications?**

Yes, Anchor is specifically designed for enterprise-scale applications. Its architecture scales gracefully with application complexity:

- **Modular Design**: Components only observe the state they need
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Predictable State**: Single source of truth eliminates state inconsistencies
- **Developer Tools**: Built-in debugging and development tools

## **How does Anchor handle immutability?**

Anchor implements **True Immutability** through a proxy-based system:

- **Direct Mutation Syntax**: Write `state.user.name = 'John'` directly
- **Write Contracts**: Changes are applied through controlled contracts
- **Compile-time Safety**: Type checking prevents unauthorized mutations
- **Runtime Protection**: Proxies trap unauthorized mutations

This approach gives you the benefits of immutability without the performance overhead of deep cloning.

## **Which frameworks does Anchor support?**

Anchor provides first-class support for:

- **React**: Full hooks integration with `useObserved` and `useWriter`
- **Vue**: Seamless reactivity integration with the Vue ecosystem
- **Svelte**: Native integration with Svelte's reactivity system
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Framework-agnostic core package

## **How do I get started with Anchor?**

1. Install Anchor using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @anchorlib/core
   # For React
   npm install @anchorlib/react
   # For Vue
   npm install @anchorlib/vue
   # For Svelte
   npm install @anchorlib/svelte
   ```

2. Import and create your first state:

   ```javascript
   import { anchor } from '@anchorlib/core';

   const state = anchor({
     count: 0,
     name: 'Anchor',
   });
   ```

3. Refer to our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide for detailed instructions.

## **Is Anchor production ready?**

Yes, Anchor is production ready with:

- **100% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across all modules
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Used in large-scale applications
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements
- **Community Support**: Active community and issue tracking

## **How does Anchor handle state persistence?**

Anchor includes built-in reactive storage solutions:

- **Persistent Storage**: Two-way binding with localStorage and IndexedDB
- **Session Storage**: Session-specific state persistence
- **KV Store**: Key-value storage for simple data
- **Table Store**: Structured data storage with querying capabilities

## **Can I use Anchor with my existing state management solution?**

Yes, Anchor can coexist with existing state management solutions. You can gradually migrate parts of your application to Anchor without rewriting everything at once.

## **How do I debug Anchor applications?**

Anchor provides several debugging tools:

- **Built-in DevTools**: Visualize state changes and component dependencies
- **Derivation Logging**: Log state changes to the console with `derive.log`
- **State Snapshots**: Capture and inspect state at any point in time
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for common issues
